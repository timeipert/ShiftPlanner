# ShiftPlanner
Shift Planner with automatic shift distribution (spec project with nostalgic win 98 design as exercise)...

## Shift Plan View
This view coordinates the shift for a specific month. Individuals (organized via the member list) can be automatically assigned to a day/shift (according to specific rules), and the assignment can be manually modified.
